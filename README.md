* Regional Metrics:

1. Revenue by Region: Comparison of sales across different regions
2. Return Rates by Region: Percentage of orders returned in each region
3. Average Delivery Time by Region: Operational performance analysis
* Operational Metrics:

1. Delivery Time Analysis: Average, minimum, and maximum delivery times
2. Product Return Rates: Return rates across product categories
* Time Trends:

1. Monthly Sales Trends: Visualization of revenue trends over time
2. Seasonality Analysis: Highlight peak sales periods, such as festive months
## 🔎 Key Insights from the Dashboard
##### The Power BI/Tableau dashboard reveals several critical business insights, including:

* Sales peaked in July ($1.7M) but saw a significant drop in Q4.
* The North region generated 64.59% of total sales, but also has the longest average delivery times.
* The Health & Beauty category generated the highest revenue ($1.45M), indicating an opportunity to expand this category further.
